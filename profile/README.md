## 🧠 Overview  

**Fusion 360** is a powerful integrated CAD, CAM, and CAE platform that enables designers, engineers, and creators to take projects from concept to production in one unified environment. Developed with collaborative workflows in mind, Fusion 360 combines parametric modeling, simulation, manufacturing preparation, and rendering into a seamless toolset optimized for modern Windows systems.

At its core, Fusion 360 provides robust 3D modeling capabilities that support both precise engineering designs and complex organic forms. Users can explore infinite shape variations, refine details with parametric constraints, and iterate quickly using direct modeling tools. Integrated simulation tools help evaluate structural performance and motion behavior before production.

Fusion 360 also bridges design and manufacturing. Its CAM features allow the generation of toolpaths for CNC machining, while additive fabrication preparation supports 3D printing workflows. Cloud-connected collaboration features keep teams aligned and projects up to date across devices and teams.

Whether for product design, mechanical engineering, or fabrication planning, Fusion 360 delivers a comprehensive solution tailored for the demands of professional workflows.
